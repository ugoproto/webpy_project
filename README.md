# webpy_project

- The project name: webpy_project (the parent directory).
- The website title: Starship Survival.

A little Python site using the web.py framework.
Based on Exercise 52, Final Exam, from [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org) by Zed Shaw.

- The site can run at a local address.
- For Linux/MacOSX users, please execute in the terminal:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
python2 bin/app.py
```

- Then visit <http://localhost:8080> to browse the site!
	
- For Windows users, please execute in the shell:

```bash
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$env:PYTHONPATH;."
py -2 bin/app.py
```

- Then go the same address as above.
- If for some reason `py -2 bin/app.py` does not work, try `py -2.7 bin/app.py` or check your Python version to launch the proper script.
- The site can also be hosted and run online at an address of your choice.
